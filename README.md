## Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository 🚀  
This is my **first project in the Data Engineering field**, created as part of my learning journey and portfolio.

The main goal of this project is to apply fundamental concepts of data warehousing, ETL pipelines, data modeling, and analytics using SQL Server, while following best practices as much as possible for a beginner.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, which consists of three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   Stores raw data as-is from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server.

2. **Silver Layer**  
   Includes data cleansing, standardization, and transformation to improve data quality.

3. **Gold Layer**  
   Contains business-ready data modeled using a **Star Schema** for reporting and analytics.

> 📌 Architecture diagrams will be added later.
